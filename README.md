Modern C++ based server side framework for optimal solutions

The philosophy and technological guidance behind Quarks can be found in this link:
[quarks philosophy](https://dev.to/lucpattyn/quarks-a-new-approach-with-a-new-mindset-to-programming-10lk)

We will have a mechanism in later stages to support various plugins. 
We will provide OpenCV as a readily available plugin.

### Testing

After initializing by issuing following command

```
./ocv_microservice_crow
```

### GET REQUESTS

### Description

a)  Put key vs value 

```
 http://0.0.0.0:18080/put?body={"key":"g1_u1","value":{"msg":"m1"}}
```
 It is recommended to "URI encode"  the body parameters . Example JS codes:

```
 jsonobj = {"key":"g1_u1", "value":{"msg":"m1"}}
 var url = "put?body=" + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(jsonobj));

 $.get(url, function( data ) {
     $( ".result" ).html( data );    
 });

```
 *If request is successful then the key would be returned as result
 
 However, GET type of requests have a limitation with parameter lengths and body param cannot be too big.
 In those cases you have to use the methods in POST section (putjson, postjson etc.)


b) Get value against key

```
 http://0.0.0.0:18080/get?key=g1_u1
```

c) List values by wildcard search with keys (you can specifiy skip and limit optionally)
```
 http://0.0.0.0:18080/getall?keys=g1_u*&skip=5&limit=10 
```
d) List sorted values by wildcard search with keys (you can specifiy skip and limit optionally)
```
 http://0.0.0.0:18080/getsorted?keys=g1_u*&sortby=msg&skip=5&limit=10   

```
  You can reverse the order by specifying des=true
```
 http://0.0.0.0:18080/getsorted?keys=g1_u*&sortby=msg&des=true&skip=5&limit=10 

```
Apply equal-to filter on a value (using eq) :
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getsorted?keys=g1_u*&skip=0&limit=10&filter={"where":{"messageTo":{"eq":"u2"}}}

```
Apply equal-to filter on a value performing multiple comparisons (using eq_any):
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getsorted?keys=g1_u*&filter={"where":{"messageTo":{"eq_any":["u2","u4"]}}}

```

e) List keys vs values by wildcard search with keys (you can specifiy skip and limit optionally)

```
 http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeys?keys=g1_u*&skip=5&limit=10 
```
To get the keys in reverse order run 
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeys?keys=g1_u*&skip=5&limit=10&reverse=true 
```

f) Get count of keys matched by wildcard search 
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getcount?keys=g1*
```

g)  remove a key
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/remove?key=g1_u1
```
number of keys successfully deleted would be returned

h) remove keys by wildcard search
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/removeall?keys=g1_u*
``` 

number of keys successfully deleted would be returned

i) check if a key already exists
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/exists?key=g1_u1
``` 

j) get a list of key value pair given a list of keys
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getlist?body=["g1_u1", "g2_u2"]
``` 
(You can specify skip and limit to this as well but should not need it)

k) increment a value saved as integer by a specified amount
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/incr?body={"key":"somecounter","step":5}

Note: Value to increment must be saved as integer with a previous call to put -
http://0.0.0.0:18081/put?body={"key":"somecounter", "value":1}
``` 

l) Execute Atoms: Atoms are set of Put and Remove operations which can be executed in a single API call

To run a set of put operations together, run:

```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/put/atom?body=
[
{"key":"g1_u2", "value":{"msg":"m1"}},
{"key":"g2_u2", "value":{"msg":"m2"}},
{"key":"g3_u3", "value":{"msg":"m3"}}
]

```

To run a set of remove operations together, run:
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/remove/atom?body=
["g1_u1","g1_u2", "g3_u3"]

```

To run a set of remove operations followed by a set of put operations, run:
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/atom?body=
{
put:[
{"key":"g1_u2", "value":{"msg":"m1"}},
{"key":"g2_u2", "value":{"msg":"m2"}},
{"key":"g3_u3", "value":{"msg":"m3"}}
}],
remove:["g1_u1","g1_u2", "g3_u3"]   

}

```
* Notes about Atoms,
   1) "Remove" operations will always be executed before "Put" in ../atom call
   2) Atoms should be used sparingly - if you have only a single put/remove operation then,
      use the put/remove apis provided for the specific purpose, not atomic ones
   3) If you have a number of put operations and no removes then use  ../put/atom (and not  ../atom)
   4) If you have a number of remove operations and no puts then use  ../remove/atom (and not ../atom)
  
m) autogenerate key with prefix and value provided

``` 
 http://0.0.0.0:18080/make?body={"prefix":"dev_","value":"101"}
 
```
* returns the key value pair as json object; if "key" is specified along with prefix 
 then a key is formed with prefix+key and no key generation occurs

n) provide a prefix, key pair for which all keys (along with values) greater than the passed key,
   starting with the prefix are returned 
   
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeysafter?body=["key_prefix", "comparekey"]

```
Multiple prefix, key pair can be provided like the following:
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeysafter?body=["key_pre1", "key1", "key_pre2", "key2", ... "key_preN", "keyN"]

```

o) provide a prefix, key pair for which the highest key (along with values and index) greater than the passed key,
   starting with the prefix is returned 
   
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeyslast?body=["key_prefix", "comparekey"]

```
Multiple prefix, key pair can be provided like the following:
```
http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeyslast?body=["key_pre1", "key1", "key_pre2", "key2", ... "key_preN", "keyN"]

```
  
### POST REQUESTS


### Description

i) Put a json object against a key:
 POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/putjson
```
BODY:
{"key":"g3_u3", "value":{ "msg":"m3"}}
```
Note: In the json body, it is required to have a "key" attribute and a "value" attribute as a part of the json object.  The json object {"msg":"m3"}  under attribute "value" is saved against the key "g3_u3" in the persistent storage

If the intention is to insert only if the key doesn't exist then use the following api:

POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/postjson
```
BODY:
{"key":"g3_u3", "value":{ "msg":"m3"}}
```
If the key already exists then the call fails.
This is more useful than calling the "exists" api to check if key exists and then call putjson,
since it's reduces an extra api call


ii) Retrieve the json object by key:
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/getjson
```
BODY: {"key":"g3_u3"}
```
iii) Retrieve an array of json objects by wildcard matching of keys..
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/iterjson
```
BODY: {"keys":"g3_u*"}
```
To test this API,
You could  post a few values against keys with putjson, for example 

```
BODY:
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/putjson
{"key":"g1_u2", "value":{"msg":"m1"}}

POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/putjson
BODY:
{"key":"g2_u2", "value":{"msg":"m2"}}

POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/putjson
BODY:
{"key":"g3_u3", "value":{"msg":"m3"}}

```
and then check the results by 
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/iterjson
BODY: {"keys":"g3_u*"}
```

iv) Get a list of key value pair given a list of keys
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/getlist
BODY: ["g1_u1", "g2_u2"]

```
(You can specify skip and limit as query parameters but should not need it)


v) Execute Atoms: Atoms are set of Put and Remove operations which can be executed in a single API call

To run a set of put operations together, run:

```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/put/atom

BODY:
[
    {"key":"g1_u2", "value":{"msg":"m1"}},
    {"key":"g2_u2", "value":{"msg":"m2"}},
    {"key":"g3_u3", "value":{"msg":"m3"}}
]

```

To run a set of remove operations together, run:
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/remove/atom

BODY:
["g1_u1","g1_u2", "g3_u3"]

```

To run a set of remove operations followed by a set of put operations, run:
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/atom

BODY:
{
put:[
    {"key":"g1_u2", "value":{"msg":"m1"}},
    {"key":"g2_u2", "value":{"msg":"m2"}},
    {"key":"g3_u3", "value":{"msg":"m3"}}
    }],
remove:["g1_u1","g1_u2", "g3_u3"]   

}

```
* Notes about Atoms,
 1) "Remove" operations will always be executed before "Put" in ../atom call
 2) Atoms should be used sparingly - if you have only a single put/remove operation then,
     use the put/remove apis provided for the specific purpose, not atomic ones
 3) If you have a number of put operations and no removes then use  ../put/atom (and not  ../atom)
 4) If you have a number of remove operations and no puts then use  ../remove/atom (and not ../atom)


vi) Autogenerate key and make a key value pair given a key-prefix and value 
``` 
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/make
BODY:
{"prefix":"MSGID_","value":"101"}

```
* returns the key value pair as json object; if "key" is specified along with prefix 
then a key is formed with prefix+key and no key generation occurs

vii) provide a prefix, key pair for which all keys (along with values) greater than the passed key,
   starting with the prefix are returned 
   
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeysafter
BODY:
["key_prefix", "key"]

```
Multiple prefix, key pair can be provided like the following:
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeysafter
BODY:
["key_pre1", "key1", "key_pre2", "key2", ... "key_preN", "keyN"]

```

viii) provide a prefix, key pair for which the highest key (along with value and index) greater than the passed key,
   starting with the prefix is returned 
   
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeyslast
BODY:
["key_prefix", "key"]

```

Multiple prefix, key pair can be provided like the following:
```
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/getkeyslast
BODY:
["key_pre1", "key1", "key_pre2", "key2", ... "key_preN", "keyN"]

```

### Filters and joins

There is also provision to run ORM style queries with searchjson and applying filters

POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/searchjson

Sample Query Format for
"querying items which are up for sale with key like item* (i.e item1, item2 etc.) , then find the sellers of such items (items has a seller_id field that contains the user_id of the seller) "

```
{
    "keys":"item*",
    "include":{
        "map": {"field":"seller_id", "as":"seller"},
        "module":"main",
        "filter":"jsFilter",
        "params":"{\"approved\":1}"
    }

}

 
```

To test it out,
First insert some users->

POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/putjson
BODY:
```
{"key":"user1", "value":{"name":"u1", "age":34}}
{"key":"user2", "value":{"name":"u2", "age":43}}
```

then insert some items->
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/putjson
BODY:
```
{
"key":"item1",
"value":{
"id": "item1",
"seller_id": "user1",
"rating": 4,
"approved": "1"
}

{
"key":"item2",
"value":{
"id": "item2",
"seller_id": "user2",
"rating": 3,
"approved": "1"
}
```

Finally, check the results by 
POST: http://0.0.0.0:18080/searchjson

So we are able to iterate items (by "keys":"item*") and then run a join operation with the filter attribute ("filter":...) through the keyword map ({"map": {"field":"seller_id", "as":"seller"}})

v8 engine has been integrated to support scripting in server side to further filter/sort queried results. 

Now the post body looks like the following 
with the js based extended filtering:

```
{
"keys":"item*",
    "include":{
        "map": {"field":"seller_id", "as":"seller"},
        "module":"main",
        "filter":"jsFilter",
        "params":"{\"approved\":1}"
    }

}

```

And the JS in server side looks like this:

```
function jsFilter() {
    var elem = JSON.parse(arguments[0]);
    var args = JSON.parse(arguments[1]);
    var match = 0;
    if(elem.approved == args.approved) {
        match = 1;        
    }

    return match;
}
```

Here module main is the main.js file residing in the server in the same path as the executable.
function is the name of the JS Function which we will use to further filter the data.

The idea is the mentioned script main.js will have a filter function with a predefined form filter(elem, params), or a sort function with predefined form sort(elem1, elem2, params) to further fitler/sort the data.

'elem' is an individual item (one of many) found by the Quarks lookup through "keys":"item*" .
We are invoking the JS module and the function while finding and iterating the matching items in C++.

It is up to the user to interpret the params in the server side and write the script codes accordingly.

In our example, we named the function - "jsFilter" in main.js. 

Quarks will allow minimum usage of scripting to ensure the server side codes remain super optimized.

## Backup and Restore
```
For backing up the database try:
http://0.0.0.0:18080/backup?body={"path":"quarks_backup_1"}

To restore simply run quarks next time using the "db" commandline parameter
 ./ocv_microservice_crow -db quarks_backup_1
 
 -db followed by the path denotes the rocksdb directory path to use when starting quarks

```

Thanks Kaisar Haq :)


After v8 engine integration and scripting support,
the next target was to allow listener support through zero mq to communicate with other processes and services
and creating the Quarks Cloud (partially done).


### Quarks Cloud

Quarks Cloud provides the functionalities for scaling and replicating nodes
(through extensive use of ZeroMQ).

Genearlly each Quarks server is called a core.
When we are using the cloud features the cores are called nodes.

There are three types of nodes:
1. Broker Node
2. Writer Node
3. Reader Node

Broker nodes are used to publish data across multiple nodes.
All writes through api calls are written to a writer node.
The writer node sends the message to broker node which publishes to multiple reader nodes.
Reader nodes are dedicated for only data reading related api calls.
This helps serving huge amount of requests because the readers are plain replica of writer node.

Conceptual flow:
												 	   
user->write apis-> [writer] -> [broker] -> [reader] <-read apis<-user	

("/put" is an example of write api and "/get" is read api example)								       

Following are the commands to start up broker, writer and readers:

Start broker node:
```
 ./ocv_microservice_crow -port 18081 -broker tcp://*:5555
 
```
* Opens a socket for communication in port 5555 to accept writer requests
  Opens a publisher at port 5556 port for subscribers(i.e readers) to listen to

Start writer node:
```
./ocv_microservice_crow -port 18082 -writer tcp://localhost:5555

```
* Connects to broker at port 5555

Start reader node:
```
./ocv_microservice_crow -port 18083 -reader tcp://localhost:5556

```
* Listens to broker at port 5556
* There can be multiple readers started in different ports.

Websocket support has been added (Not the strongest point of Quarks yet and needs improvement).

### WEBSOCKETS

#Initiate a socket:
```
var sock = new WebSocket("ws://0.0.0.0:18080/ws?_id=" + userId );
```
*Here userId is the id which would be used to uniquely identify a user, otherwise socket chat fails
Usually this id would be used by the other party (i.e a messege sender) to send messages to this user


#Room join  (must join a room to initiate chat):
```
sock.onopen = ()=>{
    console.log('open')
    var joinData = {"join":"defaultroom"};
    sock.send(JSON.stringify(joinData));
    
    // if needed to broadcast to the room about joining/presence and leave (optional)
    // add broadcast attribute.
    // ex. var joinData = {"join":"defaultroom", "broadcast":"online", "notifyOnLeave":"true"};
}

```
#Error Handling

```
sock.onerror = (e)=>{
    console.log('error',e)
}
sock.onclose = ()=>{
    console.log('close')
}

```

#Message Sending:

```
$("#send").click(()=>{
    var msgbody = $("#msg").val();

    var dataToSend = {"payload": 
                        {
                            "room":"defaultroom",
                            "to":""+friendId                        
                        },
                      "data":"" + msgBody
                  };

    sock.send(JSON.stringify(dataToSend));
    $("#msg").val("");
    
});

$("#msg").keypress(function(e){
    if (e.which == 13)
    {
        $("#send").click();
    }
});

```

#Message Handling:

```
sock.onmessage = (e)=>{
    $("#log").val(
    e.data +"\n" + $("#log").val());
}

```

#List Users in a Room :

```
sock.send(JSON.stringify({"list":""+roomname}));
sock.onmessage = (e)=>{
    $("#log").val(
    "Userlist in room " + roomname + " : " + e.data +"\n" + $("#log").val());
}

```


Quarks has plans for plugins integration.

### PLUGINS

Currently, only OpenCV is provided as a plugin (codes commented).

For those interested in testing OpenCV as plugin (uncommenting the relevant codes),
you should submit a POST request to http://localhost:18080/filters/gausian. 
The body of this request should be your binary PNG image. 
The response should be a gausian filtered image from the submited image.

OpenCV however is a plugin (an additional feature) and not the main purpose behind Quarks.
Currently it is turned off by using #ifdef _USE_PLUGIN in the codes and if (_USE_PLUGINS) in CMakeLists.txt
